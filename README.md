# All My Books Wordpress Theme
A collection of plugins and templates to create a great book catalogue website.

## General Requirements
* [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/download/) 3.8+: I haven't tested it with any version below 3.8, so I've decided that's the minimum.
* Activated Reading List plugin (included in repo).

## Local Dev Requirements
* Gems required:
 * bundler
 * compass
 * sass

## Installation
1. Clone repository in your `wp-content/` folder (if it creates it's own `all-my-books/` directory. If so, just move everything in that to the `wp-content/` directory).
2. Activate the downloaded plugins.
3. Activate the theme.
