# All My Books Wordpress Theme
For bibliophiles everywhere, AMB is a Wordpress theme made to create a great book catalogue website.

## General Requirements
* [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/download/) 3.8+: I haven't tested it with any version below 3.8, so I've decided that's the minimum.

## Installation
1. Clone repository in your `wp-content/` folder (It may create its own `all-my-books/` directory. If so, just move everything in that to the `wp-content/` directory).
2. Activate the downloaded plugins.
3. Activate the theme.
4. Start building your collection.
